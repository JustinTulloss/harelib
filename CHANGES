CHANGES
--------

Version 0.2

    Changed the default value for the auto_delete parameter
    in the Channel.exchange_declare and Channel.queue_declare
    methods to True.

    Added an 'insist' parameter to the Connection class
    constructor, defaulting to False.  Setting it to True
    indicates to the AMQP server that you don't want to
    be redirected (you're insisting to connect to the
    specified server).

    Added support for being redirected to another AMQP
    server when a Connection is opened.

    Added tests/fake_redirect_0_8.py to help with testing
    redirect support.

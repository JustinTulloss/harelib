    Added non-blocking client and demo, from
    Dmitriy Samovskiy <dmitriy.samovskiy@cohesiveft.com>:
    -----------------------

    We put together an add-on for py-amqplib that implements AMQP client
    with non-blocking sockets (see NonBlockingConnection class and
    nbloop() function in nbclient_0_8.py). nbdemo_receive.py is a demo
    script, and nbclient.zip includes both nbclient_0_8.py and
    nbdemo_receive.py.

    There are at least 2 scenarios where non-blocking sockets help, and
    both are applicable to consumers:

    1) when you want to be able to interrupt consumer's event loop without
       waiting for a next incoming message;
    2) when you want to consume messages from multiple brokers (or over
       multiple connections) in a single event loop.

Version 0.3

    Improved skeleton generating program to include much more
    information in the Python docstrings that was present in the AMQP
    spec file. Merged in the improved docstrings into the client module.

    After having a better look now at the pydocs, it turns out that in
    several methods, a default value of '' can be used for queue names
    and exchange names, so update method signatures to take advantage of
    that.

    Channel.queue_bind() can also take '' as a queue parameter, but
    unfortunately we can't set that as a default value because
    the exchange parameter can't have a default value.  In hindsight
    those args should have been swapped, but it's too late now.

    Deal with no callback being specified in basic_consume(), it
    should now quietly discard messages.

Version 0.2

    Changed the default value for the auto_delete parameter
    in the Channel.exchange_declare and Channel.queue_declare
    methods to True.

    Added an 'insist' parameter to the Connection class
    constructor, defaulting to False.  Setting it to True
    indicates to the AMQP server that you don't want to
    be redirected (you're insisting to connect to the
    specified server).

    Added support for being redirected to another AMQP
    server when a Connection is opened.

    Added tests/fake_redirect_0_8.py to help with testing
    redirect support.
